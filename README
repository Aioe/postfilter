Postfilter 0.9.1 - README


1. Introduction

	postfilter is an antispam filter for InterNetNews, a widely used NNTP server. Unlike cleanfeed - which checks *remote* articles, those 
	messages sent through other sites - postfilter scans *local* posts and tries to reject spam and various abuses. Even if it's designed for 
	large sites, notably USENET servers, postfilter *can* be safety used also by small or private hosts that need a less strong protection 
	against abuses. 

	Beware! Postfilter can't be used as a cleanfeed replacement: cleanfeed checks *remote* articles, postfilter *local* ones.

2. Requirements

	2.1 INN >= 2.4.0 compiled with perl support (--with-perl). It's recommended to use INN >= 2.4.4. 

	Beware! Postfilter could be *not* fully compatible with IPv6 at the moment. 

	2.2 The following perl modules:

 		2.2.1 Date::Parse
		2.2.2 Net::DNS
		2.2.3 Digest
		2.2.4 Digest::HMAC
		2.2.5 Digest::MD5
		2.2.6 DBI

3. Features

	3.1 A higly configurable banlist (see banlist.conf(5))

	3.2 DNSBL, URIBL and TOR support

	3.3 The maximum number of

		3.3.1 Messages
		3.3.2 Bytes
		3.3.3 Groups
		3.3.4 Followups
		3.3.5 Identical messages
		3.3.6 Rejected messages before being banned

    		can be limited per

		3.3.7 UserID
		3.3.8 Domain
		3.3.9 IP address

    		and per *two* units of time (by default: 1 Day and 10 Minutes)

	3.4 Headers can be deeply modified

	3.5 Builtin log system for data that need to be kept for legal reasons (notably sender's IP address of each locally posted message) with
	    an expernal script (postlegal that is included in this package) which handles these logs (expiration of old logs and searches)

	3.6 A simple and fast dictionary of forbidden words (see badwords.conf)

	3.7 Easy to customize

4. Installation

	4.1 Automatic installation:
	    
	    Run as root

		$ rc.news stop		  # Stop INND
		$ ./postfilter-install -c # Check dependacies
		$ ./postfilter-install -i # Install postfilter
		$ rc.news start		  # Start INND

	4.2 Installation by hands

	    Read ./doc/tutorials/how_to_install_postfilter_by_hands.txt

5. Troubleshooting

	5.1 Enable news.debug syslog facility adding the following line in syslog.conf

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
news.debug                      -/var/log/news/news.debug
#-----------------------------------------------------------------

	5.2 Check whether postfilter is correctly installed:

        	$ perl -wc [pathfilter]/postfilter/postfilter.pl 
        	$ ./postfilter-installer -c
        	$ su root
        	$ ./postfilter-installer -v
	
	5.3 If installer complaints because it doesn't find innconfval, 
	    which is needed during installation, its full path has to be 
	    inserted by hands using -s flag
	    
	    	$ su root
		$ updatedb
		$ locate innconfval
		  /news/bin/innconfval
		$ postfilter-installer -i -s /news/bin/innconfval

	5.4 Restart INND. Please *restart* it instead of reloading the configuration settings.

        	$ su root
        	$ rc.news stop
        	$ rc.news start

	5.5 Try to post a test message

		$ telnet localhost 119
              >>> Trying 127.0.0.1...
	      >>> Connected to localhost.
	      >>> Escape character is '^]'.
	      >>> 200 aioe.org InterNetNews server INN 2.4.5 ready
	      <<< MODE READER
	      >>> 200 localhost InterNetNews NNRP server INN 2.4.5 ready (posting ok).
	      <<< POST
	      >>> 340 Ok, recommended ID <ha550k$be9$1@aioe.org>
	      <<< Newsgroups: local.test                           
	      <<< From: Aioe <estasi@aioe.org>
	      <<< Subject: test
	      <<<
	      <<< This is a test, only a test
	      <<<.
	      >>> 240 Article posted <ha550k$be9$1@aioe-casa.aioe.org>
