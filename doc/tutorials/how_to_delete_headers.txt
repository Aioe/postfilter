How to delete Headers from locally posted articles using the nnrpd perl filter

1. Description

The NNRPD perl filter includes a strange way to delete the headers inside messages sent by local users.
There're three or four classes of headers and each class requires a different deletion perl command that
can vary from INN version to version so the only way to know how to delete an header is through the 
following list:

A. System headers

$system_headers = "^Path|^From|^Newsgroups|^Subject|^Control|^Supersedes|
		   ^Followup\-To|^Date|^Organization|^Lines|^Sender|^Approved|^Distribution|
		   ^Expires|^Message\-ID|^References|^Reply\-To|^NNTP\-Posting\-Host|
		   ^Mime\-Version|^Content\-Type|^Content\-Transfer\-Encoding|^X\-Trace|
		   ^X\-Complaints\-To|^NNTP\-Posting\-Date|^Xref|^Injector\-Info|^Summary|
		   ^Keywords|^Date\-Received|^Received|^Posted|^Posting\-Version|
		   ^Relay\-Version|^Bcc|^To|^CC";

B. User Agent related headers

$user_agents = "^X\-Newsreader|^X\-Mailer|^User\-Agent"; 

C. All other headers unlisted before.

2. Table about allowed deletion methods

|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|	  	        NNRPD Version Table		      |
|---|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| # | 	    Headers         |    INN 2.4    |    INN 2.5      | 
|---|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| A | $system_headers       |     undef     |     undef       |
|---|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| B | $user_agents          |    delete     |     undef       |
|---|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| C | All other headers	    |    delete     | delete or undef |
|---|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------| 


"undef" refers to "$hdr{'somewhat'} = undef;" perl statement.
"delete" means "delete $hdr{'somewhat'};"

3. Notes

Beware: with inn 2.4, if the perl filter tries to delete an $user_agent header using 'undef'
        that article will be *rejected* by innd because nnrpd cleans the content of that header
	without deleting it and innd doesn't accept empty headers.

Beware: with inn 2.4 and 2.5, every attempt to delete one of $system_headers through 'delete' will
        silently discarded by nnrpd. Simply the 'delete' command will have no effects without
        any kind of log notice.

Beware: some header (notably From, Newsgroups, Subject, Path, Date and Message-ID) can't
	be deleted. If the perl filter tries to delete one of them, the article is rejected by innd
	because some mandatory header is missing. Please note that nnrpd doesn't make any check
	before deleting some header so there's no automatic way to avoid unwanted rejections.
