Postfilter ver. 0.8.1
Copyright 2005-2009 Paolo Amoroso (Aioe) <freedom@aioe.org>

1. Summary

Postfilter is an NNRPD perl filter (filter_nnrpd.pl) which scans the messages sent by local users. 
It could limit the number of messages per user, IP or domain, provides a set of banlists and could deeply modify the headers. 
It's designed for large site.

2. Requirements

2.1 INN >= 2.4.0 compiled with perl support (--with-perl). It's recommended to use INN >= 2.4.4

2.2 The following perl modules:

Date::Parse;
Net::DNS;
Digest;
Digest::HMAC;
Digest::MD5;
DBI;

3. Installation

3.1 Manual Installation

3.1.1 Edit the top of src/postfilter.pl and set the right innshellconfvar path

3.1.2 Copy the directory ./etc/ in the same directory of all INND configuration files with the name /postfilter/

	$ cp -r etc/ /etc/news/postfilter/
	$ chown news.news /etc/news/postfilter -R

3.1.3 Change the postfilter configuration (see postfilter.conf(5) and examples in /usr/share/doc/postfilter/examples/postfilter.conf/)

3.1.4 Copy all files in src/ in your pathfilter directory (the same which contains filter_nnrpd.pl). Debian sets this to /etc/news/filter/

	$ mkdir [pathfilter]/postfilter/
        $ cp -r src/* [pathfilter]/postfilter
	$ chown news.news [pathfilter]/postfilter/ -R

	Those who need to know where is [pathfilter] can execute (innconfval could be - notably with debian - outside binary paths)

	$ innconfval pathfilter

3.1.5 Make a backup copy of your original filter_nnrpd.pl file than link postfilter.pl to filter_nnrpd.pl

        $ mv [pathfilter]/filter_nnrpd.pl [pathfilter]/filter_nnrpd.pl.backup
        $ ln -s [pathfilter]/postfilter/postfilter.pl [pathfilter]/filter_nnrpd.pl
	$ chown news.news [pathfilter]/filter_nnrpd.pl

3.1.6 Create inside your spooldir (usually /var/spool/news/ ) a directory called "postfilter" with a subdir called "saved". This directory must be 
      writable by 'news' user.

        $ mkdir -p [spooldir]/postfilter/saved
	$ touch [spooldir]/access.log
	$ touch [spooldir]/legal.log
	$ chown news.news -R [spooldir]/postfilter/*
	$ chmod +w [spooldir]/postfilter/

	Those who need to know where is [pathfilter] can execute (innconfval could be - notably with debian - outside binary paths)

        $ innconfval pathspool

3.1.7 Copy other files in the right location

	$ cp -r man/man1/* /usr/share/man/man1/
	$ cp -r sbin/* /sbin/
	$ chown root.root /sbin/postlegal
	$ chmod +rx /sbin/postlegal 

3.1.8 Try to post a test message than see the news.err syslog file

3.2 Automatic installation

3.2.1 Execute as root

	$ ./postfilter-installer

4. Troubleshooting

4.1 Enable news.debug syslog facility adding the following line in syslog.conf

news.debug                      -/var/log/news/news.debug

4.2 Check whether postfilter is correctly installed:

	$ perl -wc [pathfilter]/postfilter/postfilter.pl 
	$ postfilter-installer -c
	$ su root
	$ postfilter-installer -v

4.2 Restart INND. Please *restart* it instead of reloading the configuration settings.

	$ su root
	$ rc.news stop
	$ rc.news start

4.3 Read all news.debug informations related with postfilter

	$ tail -f /var/log/news/news.debug | grep " filter: "

4.4 Those who need help can ask for assistance using:
