Postfilter 0.8.1 (30/09/2009)

New Features:

	1. Now postfilter has got an installer - ./postfilter-install.pl - that is able to copy all needed files in the right places

	2. UUEncoded and YENC encoded binaries are separately handled. 
	   Now $config{'allow_yenc'} permits to allow yenc encoded binaries, $config{'allow_uuencode'} uuencoded messages. 

	3. Postfilter is now shipped with a set of manpages:
	   postfilter.conf.5 
	   banlist.conf.5    
	 
	4. More documentation in doc/ :
	   how_to_delete_headers.txt explains the right way to delete headers inside an nnrpd filter script
  
	5. X-No-Archive can be deleted 
	   $config{'delete_header_x-no-archive'} sets whether to keep or delete it

	6. A new set of postfilter.conf statements allows to determine which checks have to be made:

	   $config{’check_users’} 
           $config{’check_tor’}   
           $config{’check_custom’}                    
           $config{’check_banlist’}                   
           $config{’check_rbl’}                       
           $config{’check_uribl’}
	   $config{'check_distribution'}
	   $config{'check_groups_existence'}
	   $config{'check_white-list'}

	7. Legal logs - the ones saved inside legal.log - can be handled in a much better way through a new utility, /sbin/postlegal
	   The old postfilter-legal.pl was removed.

Enhancements:
	
	1. Now Postfilter is able to detect whether INN 2.4 or 2.5 is running 
	   $config{'version'} shows which is the current INN version.

	2. Postfilter can be configured in order to skip URIBL.com or SURBL URIBL check
	   Now $config{’check_surbl’} enables or disables SURBL check, $config{’check_uriblcom’} controls URIBL.com check

	3. Now postfilter is able to accept, reject or mark all articles that come from TOR. 
	   Old $config{'block_tor'} was removed.
	   A new $config{'tor_network'} allows to accept articles that come from TOR nodes ("accept"), to reject them ("reject"),
           to mark ("mark") each post from TOR inserting a custom header 'X-TOR-Router: TOR_IP' and adding 'tor-network' inside the Path.

	4. 'Domain' based users' access rights check must be explicitly enabled through $config{’enable_domain_check’}

Bugfixes:

	1. A much better MySQL code that correctly handles the errors
	
	2. access.pm works much better and it's better factorialized

	3. All modules (modules/*.pm) are fully commented

	4. Postfilter now uses INN::Syslog instead of Sys::Syslog

	5. Now messages that come from stdin (if nnrpd is invoked through command line) are correctly handled

	6. Postfilter skips TOR checks if an article comes from stdin or localhost, 
	   URIBL checks are skipped if no URI are found inside the body

	7. if custom rules return a code that hasn't got a corresponding error string, a message is printed in the logs and that article is
           rejected with a generic rejection string ($quickref[63]).

	8. if postfilter is linked to the wrong nnrpd perl filter file (nnrpd_*.pl inside pathfilter), now an error is printed
           in the logs (news.crit) and an human readable error message is sent to the remote client.

	9. Removed 'hidden' User-Agent because now user agent related headers can be deleted. 
	   Added a new subroutines that works both with inn 2.4 and 2.5

       10. Now all regular expressions are case insensitive

       11. Only *accepted* articles are counted as multipost

       12. If an article is rejected because it's sent to an unexistent group, the error string shows which is the missing group.
